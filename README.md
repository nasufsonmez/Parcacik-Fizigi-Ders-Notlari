**README: Particle Physics Lecture Notes**

**Overview**

This repository contains comprehensive lecture notes on particle physics, covering fundamental concepts, theoretical frameworks, and advanced topics in the field. These notes are designed for students, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to deepen their understanding of particle physics, from basic principles to cutting-edge developments.

**Suggested Usage**

**Students**: Use these notes as supplementary reading material alongside your course lectures. The notes provide detailed explanations and worked examples to help reinforce concepts.

**Researchers**: These notes serve as a useful reference guide for particle physics theory and experimental methods, with citations to key literature.
